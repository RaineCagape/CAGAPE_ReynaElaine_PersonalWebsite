	        Hi there! Raine again and meet my fancy side \(^u^)/ <br><br><br>
			You will know most of my likings and things <br>
			that I spent most in my leisure times . I'm <br>
			kinda random but sometimes being too absorb <br>
			of specific things that caught me. Most of the <br>
			time spend thinking of my own world or new ideas <br>
			or observe everything around me	then there goes <br>
			curiosity and wonders and sometimes wanders but <br>
			these things made stay creative and imaginative.<br><br>
			So yeah feel free to wander here </p>

			<p style="text-align:left">
				<br><br>
				I spend most of my free time <br>
				sketching some characters <br>
				with my class buddies everywhere. <br>
				In our own pads, notebooks <br>
				or scratch paper; just to break our boredom. <br>
				Still learning at sketching realistic <br>
				ones from people to places <br>
				and painting but just those easy ones. <br>
				Tried some digital art <br>
				through photoshop or paint tool sai. <br>
				(Side note: Thanks to Marny)<br>
				Art is also one those things <br>
				I can create of my own world in the visual part.
				(See Artworks for more)<br>

				I also engage in sports especially volleyball. <br>
				It was awesome when your mind and movements have <br>
				used at the same time, especially when you and your team <br>
				have to keep the ball in the air just keep the game alive.<br>
				Unfortunately I just rarely get the opportunity <br>
				to play lately unlike last years that have more time even <br>
				joining the competitions. Also I'm not just have focused on <br>
				a specific sport, I actually have played basketball and <br>
				wanna try soccer and mixed-martial arts...someday if have <br>
				the chance.
				<br>
				
			<p style="text-align:left">
				<br><br><br>
				Creating harmony through musical <br>
				instrument is my most favorite! Even when <br>
				I'm desperate for it, my fingers can't stop <br> 
				tapping anywhere just to make some sound. <br>
				It always mesmerizes me when I hear every <br>
				different rhythms of every different instruments, <br>
				it just give me chills and into a new <br>
				perspective. Strings is my forte so far and <br>
				still looking for new intrument to learn <br>
				especially piano(Since I'm unfortunate <br>
				to have these instruments). I tried to make <br>
				some songs but just the chorus part and I don't 
				know how to finish it. Also through this, it helps<br>
				me speak out what I've gone through and that's how 
				beautifull it is.<br>

				<br><br><br>
				I'm a huge fan of animated series and films. <br>
				They're good stress relievers you know. <br>
				It's kinda surprisingly that you can get a more of <br>
				lessons you can get than those typical tv series. <br>
			
			    <br>
				Cats and Dogs! I really really love them equally both.<br>
				Also I like other pets like rabbits and hamsters.<br>
				Oh and polar bears too xD<br>
				
				<br>
				Alternative Rock Music! \m/ One of my most fave bands <br>
				are Imagine Dragons, Paramore, Beartooth, etc, etc. But I still <br>
				try not to be bias from other genres... but Alternative ROCKS!!.<br>
